# Personal-web-project
This repository documents my journey in learning the skills required to build fully developed websites. Each project I create along the way will be recorded here as part of my growth in web development. My focus is not only on functionality but also on creating responsive designs and visually appealing, user-friendly interfaces that align with modern web standards.
